This mess wants to live at /svc/yamenu
-- you can probably move it but editing will be required.
   - I'll try to work on limiting this to a single file in release

You'll need asterisk 19.7 with chan-sccp, newer versions won't work yet.

-- You can skip most of this by using ./bin/quickstart.sh --
	Copy secrets.yml.example to secrets.yml
		# cp secrets.yml.example secrets.yml


HTTP
----
You'll want to either use the existing httpd config or setup your own.
- You can start the pre-configured httpd with ./bin/start-demo.sh

You will need to provide support for perl CGIs on whatever port you configure.

You'll also want to serve the tftp/ directory on port 6970 non-SSL to improve boot times.

Random crap that'll help you get things going

-------------------
BOOTING SCCP PHONES
-------------------
You'll want a working tftp for cisco 79[246]5 phones.

This will consist of the following:
	- Files i've shipped in tftp/
	- firmware I cannot ship, you'll have to find your own
	  - See doc/FIRMWARE.txt for last releases and checksums
	- Symlinks from appropriate template in tftp/ to SEPxxxx.cnf.yml where xxxx is your phone's MAC in upper-case letters.
